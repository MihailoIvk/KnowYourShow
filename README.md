# About project
In this project, I demonstrated my skills in ReactJS, ReactRedux, and for designing SASS and FontAwesome. I also worked with npm packages like axios, react-router-dom, and the library 'react-slick' which I used in creating carousel slide for my movies. This is my first big project and I am still new to all these concepts but with various youtube tutorials and some Udemy courses, I managed to get it right. Since API doesn’t have a ‘most popular’ option, on the home page I added my custom search word.

# Know Your Show
As about application this is application made for getting info about some movies or TV-shows. As you enter the app, on the home page, you see "Lord of the Rings" movies and all the TV-shows that contains a word "Prison" in it. In the header is a search bar where you can search for movie or TV-show you want to get infomrations about. When the search is complete, you will get all the movies and TV-shows that have the key word you searched for. Also you can click on movie card and get more information about movie(TV-show) in question.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
